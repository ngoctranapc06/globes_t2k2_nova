# globes_t2k2_nova
These plots are for t2k2 + nova sensitivities to CP-violation with constraint from reactor.
The plots are obtained for sin^2(\theta_23) = 0.5, normal mass hierarchy, \delta_CP = -\pi/2. 
With ultimate constraint from reactor, the sensitivities increase from 22% to 28% for NOvA and from 29% to 37% for T2K2. 
By combinning T2K2 and NOvA, sensitivity increases from 213% to 224% with respect to NOvA, and from 43% to 46% with respect to T2K2. 
By reducing sys. uncertainties of both NOvA and T2K2 to a level of 2%, the sensitivity increases from 16% to 18%.
